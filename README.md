# Hexagon Grid Design with React Native

Interactive and visually engaging hexagonal grid implementation built with **Expo**, **React Native**. This project features ripple animations, dynamic theme switching (light/dark modes), and coding-themed icons in a honeycomb structure.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Animations**: Ripple effect on hexagons when pressed.
- **Dynamic Theme Switching**: Toggle between light and dark modes.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes.
- **Coding-Themed Icons**: Fun and relatable icons for developers.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **React Native**: Framework for building cross-platform mobile apps.
- **Expo**: Managed workflow for hassle-free development.
- **Animated API**: For smooth animations.
- **Dimensions API**: To adapt UI elements to different screen sizes.

## 🔄 How It Works

### Honeycomb Layout
The grid is structured using a predefined `HONEYCOMB_STRUCTURE` array, determining the number of hexagons in each row.

### Ripple Animation
The ripple effect is achieved by calculating the distance from the pressed hexagon to others and triggering animations sequentially.

### Dynamic Themes
A `useState` hook toggles between light and dark themes, changing styles dynamically.
